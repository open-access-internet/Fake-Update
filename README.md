# Fake Update Program

This is a simple C++ program that simulates fake updates. It is designed to mislead users by displaying a terminal, making it appear like a software update is taking place. The program simulates an update process without actually changing anything on the computer.

## Features

- **Simulates an update**: The program shows a progress bar that makes it look like an update is being installed.
- **Delays**: Artificial delays are added to give the impression of a long update process.
- **Customizable progress**: You can adjust the duration and the progress of the update.

> **Note**: This program is intended for educational and entertainment purposes. It should not be used to deceive or cause harm. But prank a friend is a exeption.

## Installation

# Option 1

1. Make sure you have a C++ compiler installed (such as [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/) or [MSVC](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/)).
2. Clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/open-access-internet/Fake-Update.git
    ```
3. Navigate to the project folder:
    ```bash
    cd fake-update-app
    ```
4. Compile the C++ code:
    ```bash
    g++ -o fake_update fake_update.cpp
    ```
5. Run the program:
    ```bash
    ./fake_update
    ```
